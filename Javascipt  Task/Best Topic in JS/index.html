        <h2>JavaScript Coding Conventions</h2>
        <p>Naming and declaration rules for variables and functions</p>
        <p>Programming practices and principles</p>
        <p>Improves code readability</p>
        <p>Make code maintenance easier</p>
        <p>Rules for the use of white space, indentation, and comments.</p>

        <h2>JavaScript Best Practices</h2>
        <p>Avoid global variables, avoid new, avoid ==, avoid eval()</p>
        <p>It is a good coding practice to put all declarations at the top of each script or function</p>
        <p>It is a good coding practice to initialize variables when you declare them.</p>
        <p>Always treat numbers, strings, or booleans as primitive values. Not as objects</p>
        <p>Beware that numbers can accidentally be converted to strings or NaN (Not a Number).</p>
        <p>Always end your switch statements with a default. Even if you think there is no need for it.</p>
        <p>The eval() function is used to run text as code. In almost all cases, it should not be necessary to use it.
            Because it allows arbitrary code to be run, it also represents a security problem.</p>
        <p>The === operator forces comparison of values and type:</p>
        <h3>Don't Use new Object()</h3>
        <p>Use {} instead of new Object()</p>
        <p>Use "" instead of new String()</p>
        <p>Use 0 instead of new Number()</p>
        <p>Use false instead of new Boolean()</p>
        <p>Use [] instead of new Array()</p>
        <p>Use /()/ instead of new RegExp()</p>
        <p>Use function (){} instead of new Function()</p>

        <h2>JavaScript Common Mistakes</h2>
        <p>JavaScript programs may generate unexpected results if a programmer accidentally uses an assignment operator
            (=), instead of a comparison operator (==) in an if statement.</p>
        <p>adding a number as a number will produce a different result from adding a number as a string:</p>

        <h2>JavaScript Performance</h2>
        <p>Loops are often used in programming.Each statement in a loop, including the for statement, is executed for
            each iteration of the loop.Statements or assignments that can be placed outside the loop will make the loop
            run faster.</p>
        <p>Accessing the HTML DOM is very slow, compared to other JavaScript statements.If you expect to access a DOM
            element several times, access it once, and use it as a local variable:</p>
        <p>Don't create new variables if you don't plan to save values.</p>
        <p>Putting your scripts at the bottom of the page body lets the browser load the page first.</p>
        <p>An alternative is to use defer="true" in the script tag. The defer attribute specifies that the script should
            be executed after the page has finished parsing, but it only works for external scripts.

            If possible, you can add your script to the page by code, after the page has loaded:</p>
        <p>
            window.onload = function () {
            var element = document.createElement("script");
            element.src = "myScript.js";
            document.body.appendChild(element);
            };

        </p>
        <p>Avoid using the with keyword. It has a negative effect on speed. It also clutters up JavaScript scopes.

            The with keyword is not allowed in strict mode.</p>
